Hello!
My name is Leandro, I`m a 28 years old with background on the musical industry.

I ÃÅve recently started my journey as a developer and I`m quite excited about it as I feel I`ve always been keen at logic and problem
solving.

One could ask me: Why should I consider a former musician as a good candidate for a development carrer?

Well, actually I`m a graduated composer, and you`d be probably amazed to know that composition and programming have a LOT in common, not only on the logic way of thinking that both require, but also and foremost, both areas are focused in putting together puzzles to solve some problem, or create a new experience.

I hope to be able to contribute with your team, as I`ve really identified myself with your bussiness culture and environment.

I have enclosed my CV for your review. I  appreciate your time and consideration of my candidacy.

Rio de Janeiro / RJ - Brazil

Yours sincerely,
Leandro Parisi
